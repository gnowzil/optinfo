* VNC Remote Desktop (Linux)

We want to use our local machine to connect to a remote desktop on our remote machine (for ex, remote.ucsd.edu).

** Starting a VNC Session on the remote server:
SSH into the remote machine and run the fllowing to start up the virtual desktop
>>  vncserver :NN
where NN is a 2-digit number.  This will start a seession on port 59NN, the remote port number. 


** Connecting to the remote VNC seession:
Do the following on your local machine.

*** Create SSH Tunnel to encrypt connection:
>> ssh -C -f -B -L <local_port_number>:localhost:59NN me@myserver.ucsd.edu
where 59NN is the number you chose in the previous step.

*** Connect on MacOS:
Click on the desktop.  Then, on the menu bar, click on the "" and on "Connect to Server".  In the address field, type in "vnc://localhost:<local_port_number>".


*** Connect on Linux:
Use some VNC software (e.g., Remmina on Ubuntu) to connect to localhost:<local_port_number>.
